The top floor acceleration is a measure of the human comfort in the structure during an earthquake. Base isolation has become a traditional concept for structural design of buildings and bridges in high risk areas.</p>
<h3 id="they-are-two-closely-connected-aspects">They are two closely connected aspects.</h3><p>This opens in a new window. Basic design procedures are presented including determination of design earthquake forces modelling of base-isolation layers modelling of the superstructure selection of ground motions time-history analyses and performance criteria. Many are being already constructed and many are under construction. Anti seismic designs is base isolation which may not reduce the ground movement but would help in keeping the impact of ground movement to its minimal extend. The first is design of base isolation device and the second is design of structural elements above the isolation layer.

<p>They are two closely connected aspects. Base isolation is a technique developed to prevent or minimise damage to buildings during an earthquake. This paper describes recent implementations of base isolation and describes an approximate linear theory of isolation which can be used for the design of base isolation systems that use multilayer elastomeric isolators. While a relatively simple concept base isolation has a long and involved history of engineering influence and will take many more years to refine. The economy of base isolation is not viewed in terms of its initial installment but over the design period of the structure during which it is expected to experience earthquake.

In layman terms base isolation can be understood by comparing it to suspension system used in automobiles. It has been used in New Zealand as well as in India Japan Italy and the USA.
