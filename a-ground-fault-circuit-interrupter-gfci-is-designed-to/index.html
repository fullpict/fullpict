<p>A ground-fault circuit-interrupter GFCI is an electrical device either a receptacle or circuit breaker which is designed to protect people from electric shock. If a persons body starts to receive a shock the GFCI senses this and cuts off the power before heshe can get injured. The GFCI is designed to open the circuit or a portion of the circuit to a load within a predetermined value. The first introduction of a ground fault circuit interrupter occurred in the 1968 National Electric Code NEC.

<p>It works by comparing the amount of current going to and returning from equipment along the circuit conductors. This value must be less than the current level required to operate the overcurrent protective device of the circuit. The GFCI works on the same principle as of residual current protective devices. Ground fault interrupters are designed to protect from electrical shock by interrupting a household circuit when there is a difference in the currents in the hot and neutral wires. As soon as the current flowing through the hot conductor is in the range of 4 to 6 milli-amperes more than the current flowing in the return grounded conductor the GFCI senses this unbalance and trips opens the circuit off.

<p>A ground fault circuit interrupter called a GFCI or GFI is an inexpensive electrical device that can either be installed in your electrical system or built into a power cord to protect you from severe electrical shocks. A Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter GFCI for short is an electrical safety device designed to prevent fatal electrical shocks due to ground faults. GFCI or Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters are made to detect even a small leak of electrical current. Even if a system is properly grounded minor faults in a circuit can cause a dangerous shock to a person using an appliance. The basic definition of a ground-fault circuit-interrupter GFCI is a general-use device whose function is to interrupt the electric circuit to a load within an established period of time. A Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter Gfci Is A Device That Shuts Off An Electric Power Circuit When It Detects That Curren Gfci Electrical Code Electric Shock.</p>

<p>WHAT IS A GFCI. If it detects a ground fault &ndash; an unintentional electrical. Short for Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter a GFI also known as GFCI is a type of electrical outlet designed to protect you and your family against electrical shock fire andor fatal electrocution. A ground-fault circuit interrupter or GFCI is a device used in electrical wiring to disconnect a circuit when unbalanced current is detected between an energized conductor and a neutral return conductor. Even if a system is properly grounded minor faults in a circuit can cause a dangerous shock to a person using an appliance.

<p>Such waveforms can be caused by diode or thyristor rectifier circuit in electronic loads. GFCIs have played a key role in reducing electrocutions. Ground fault interrupters are designed to protect from electrical shock by interrupting a household circuit when there is a difference in the currents in the hot and neutral wires. It works by comparing the amount of current going to and returning from equipment along the circuit conductors. GFCI protection should not be confused with ground-fault protection for equipment or grounding in general.

<p>A ground fault circuit interrupter GFCI breaks the fault current. The GFCI is designed to open the circuit or a portion of the circuit to a load within a predetermined value. A Circuit breaker GFCI is installed in the electrical panel box. A ground-fault circuit interrupter GFCI is the only protection device designed to protect people against electric shock from an electrical system. Every time a GFCI outlet shuts off the power flow theres a small reset button on the front that will pop out on the outlet.

<p>A ground fault circuit interrupter GFCI breaks the fault current. A ground fault circuit interrupter GFCI monitors the current balance between the ungrounded hot conductor and the grounded conductor. The ground-fault circuit interrupter or GFCI is a fast-acting circuit breaker designed to shut off electric power in the event of a ground-fault within as little as 140 of a second. A ground fault circuit interrupter called a GFCI or GFI is an inexpensive electrical device that can either be installed in your electrical system or built into a power cord to protect you from severe electrical shocks. A ground-fault circuit interrupter or GFCI is a device used in electrical wiring to disconnect a circuit when unbalanced current is detected between an energized conductor and a neutral return conductor.
