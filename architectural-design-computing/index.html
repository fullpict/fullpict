<p>As such the computer architecture governs the design of a family of computers and defines the logical interface that is targeted by programming languages and their compilers. IEEE defines architectural design as the process of defining a collection of hardware and software components and their interfaces to establish the framework for the development of a computer system This framework is established by examining the software requirements document and designing a model for providing implementation details. Spatial Computing in Architectural Design is about formulating and solving spatial design problems in architecture.
