Teams from over one-hundred institutions must design fabricate and demonstrate the flight capabilities of an unmanned electric radio-controlled aircraft that best meets specified. This years requirements involve developing a multi-purpose aircraft to support carrier operations. The objective of the competition is to design a remote controlled unmanned aerial vehicle UAV to complete a series of challenging tasks and to compete against UAVs constructed by other. Started in 1996 by the AIAA Applied Aerodynamics Aircraft Design and Flight Test Technical Committees as an opportunity for university students to apply real-world aircraft design experience by giving them the opportunity to validate their analytic studies.
