The first variant is designed for seals for which it is impossible to change their external. Architectural geometry is an area of research which combines applied geometry and architecture which looks at the design analysis and manufacture processes. Basic algorithms for creating the primary components are presented and discussed. Geometric modeling is a central issue in developing a data base to support integrated engineering design. It lies at the core of architectural design and strongly challenges contemporary practice the so-called architectural practice of the digital age.</p>
