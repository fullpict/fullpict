The relief valve allowed vapor to vent outwards but there was no vacuum relief. This can be very onerous so the alternative is to set the deign pressure to say 12 bar. For vessels that will experience external pressure design pressure is based on the maximum difference between internal and external pressure. Pressure vessels can be dangerous and fatal accidents have. Pressure vessels are prone to explosion while in operation due to possible errors in material selection design and other engineering activities.</p>
