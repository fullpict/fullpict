<p>Define the Problem Write a statement defining the problem you have been asked to solve. The system uses magnetic forces for levitation propulsion and guidance of the vehicle thereby making practically negligible the friction forces and allowing very high speeds. Maglev systems represent an entirely new concept in transportation.</p>

The system uses magnetic forces for levitation propulsion and guidance of the vehicle thereby making practically negligible the friction forces and allowing very high speeds. The best maglev speaker of 2021 is found after hours of research and using all the current models. Initial investigation on three different wind profiles and the suitable airfoil provide the degree of impact at angle of 30 to have the highest lift coefficient for the chosen airfoil structure. Since we have already gone through the maglev speaker research process we understand this problem.

<p>Maglev is a transport system that uses the magnetic levitation to move vehicles without contact to the guideway. A maglev design incorporated with the optimized wind turbine is presented in this work. This is the same technology used by Teslas Hyperloop which makes the ride smooth and the train exceptionally safe. Germany built and tested a string of prototype maglev systems and called their design the TransRapid Figure 1. The maglev inertial actuators with high power and mass maybe effective for lateral vibration control of a propulsion shafting.

<p>The same magnetic forces that lift the train also move it forward and keep it centered within the guideway. Darrieus rotor was a combination of three-bucket Savonius and three-bladed Darrieus rotors with the Savonius placed on top of the. But the mass power ratio of the actuators currently in use is too small to meet the requirements. One way to model MAGLEV is with a simple resistor and inductor in series shown in Figure 42.
