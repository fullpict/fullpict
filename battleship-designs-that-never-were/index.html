<p>The four ships none of which were named were ordered between October and November of 1921. No its right in the article in your question link. Their construction was suspended on November 18th 1921 and they and the N3 Battleships were cancelled in February 1922 due to the limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty. These were to be joined by the four ship Amagi class battle cruiser class. Designed to see just how big American battleships could get while still being able to use the Panama Canal the Tillmans were never built. Pin On Pixel Art.</p>

<p>Their construction was suspended on November 18th 1921 and they and the N3 Battleships were cancelled in February 1922 due to the limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty. They were to be joined by the 4 improved Tosa class or Kii class fast battleships of 42000 which were ordered but never laid down. As for my timeline we shall see. Public domain via Wikipedia. It probably wasnt fully understood at the time but the end of the battleship era was at hand.
