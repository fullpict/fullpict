During the design phase of the 2002 FSAE vehicle. Technically this includes the mass of the wheel axles tyres wheel hubs and other components. An A-frame is a basic structure designed to bear a load in a lightweight economical manner. The most common independent suspension design up front is unequal length A-arms.

<p>This paper is an introduction to Formula SAE FSAE suspension and frame design based on the experience of the design team at UM-Rolla. This paper presents the procedure of design and analysis both kinematic and dynamic of the front double A-arm push-rod suspension system for a formula student race car. Suspension design for other vehicles is similar though the process may not be as well established. Technically this includes the mass of the wheel axles tyres wheel hubs and other components. A good suspension must therefore incorporate a good kinematics design to keep the tire as perpendicular to the pavement as possible optimal damping and spring rates to keep the tire on the ground at all times and strong components that do not deflect under the loads induced upon them.

<p>The suspension was designed to maximize travel. Check Out Top Brands On eBay. As with nearly all rear end or suspension swaps whether its a 4-link ladder bar or fully-independent design the modifications usually begin with the installation of a rear subframe. Hence there is a need to have a procedure by following which the suspension system can be designed. Originally automobile designs used the body-on-frame construction where a load-bearing chassis consisting of a ladder frame the powertrain and the suspension formed the base vehicle which then supported a non-load-bearing body.

The rear suspension was identified to be the H-frame 1 lateral link per side knuckle hub tires and rims. This is commonly referred to as back-halfing a frame and is a whole lot simpler than it may sound to the novice fabricator. Suspension Design Tips 14 Minimize Unsprung weight.

<p>Of course one aims to avoid compromise in any direction but inevitably some criteria will be given priority over others. This design can greatly contribute to an increase in unsprung weight or weight that simply is not supported by the suspension parts of your car. Hence there is a need to have a procedure by following which the suspension system can be designed. Unsprung weight or the weight comprised by tire wheel and suspension affects how well the tire follows the bumps and dips in the road surface.
