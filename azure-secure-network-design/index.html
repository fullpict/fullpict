Continually monitor network security with Azure Sentinel Security Center and Network Watcher.

<p>Azure Network Security Groups can be used for basic layer 3 and 4 access controls between Azure Virtual Networks their subnets and the internet. Although this is the basic design of a perimeter network there are many different designs like back-to-back tri-homed and multi-homed. SonarCloud helps you assess your code health and build applications with clean safe code. The design models include multiple options with all resources in a single VNet to enterprise-level operational environments that span across multiple VNets using a Transit VNet.
