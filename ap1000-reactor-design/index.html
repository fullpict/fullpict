<p>The chairman Gregory B. Conventional reactors rely on defence-in-depth made up of layers of redundancy and diversity this is where say two valves are fitted instead of one. We are content that Westinghouse has made sufficient progress against each of the GDA is sues to complete this phase of regulatory assessment. With the AP1000 Westinghouse sought to design a reactor that operated using conventional pressurized water reactor principles while incorporating novel safety measures in order to increase reliability and cost-competiveness relative to. The reactor vessel is approximately 395 feet 120 m long and has an inner diameter at the core region of 159 inches 4039 m.

<p>Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards ACRS. Nuclear Regulatory Commission voted to approve the design for the Westinghouse AP1000 1100 MW nuclear reactor for use in the US. The reactor vessel is approximately 395 feet 120 m long and has an inner diameter at the core region of 159 inches 4039 m. With the AP1000 Westinghouse sought to design a reactor that operated using conventional pressurized water reactor principles while incorporating novel safety measures in order to increase reliability and cost-competiveness relative to. Regulators have concluded that Westinghouses AP1000 nuclear reactor design is suitable for construction in the UK.

The first milestone deals with the NRCs review of the design itself to see if it can be approved or certified for US. Nuclear Regulatory Commission voted to approve the design for the Westinghouse AP1000 1100 MW nuclear reactor for use in the US. Fast tracking the AP1000 in order to grab federal nuclear loan. Therefore I have awarded a Design Acceptance Confirmation DAC which marks the closure of GDA and means that the reactor design is suitable for construction on.
