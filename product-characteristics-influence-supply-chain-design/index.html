<p>22 Supply chain design deﬁning the concept For the purposes of this paper we deﬁne supply chain design as. We carry out a simulation investigation to determine the impact of each product characteristic on the supply chain performance for the two different strategies. The effect of design on the supply chain means that it is essential that logistics and supply chain staff are involved at the product design stage. Distribution occurs between every pair of stages in the supply chain. Identifying the desired strategic outcomes for the ﬁrm.

<p>Distribution occurs between every pair of stages in the supply chain. Research in supply chain modeling has only scratched the surface of how supply chain strategies or decision variables may affect a given performance measure or a set of performance measures. Have compared simultaneous design with sequential design and found that a gain of 125 can be expected when the product family and the supply chain are optimized together. The authors look at how product characteristics in general influence the design of supply chains and their effect on different stages of supply chains. We carry out a simulation investigation to determine the impact of each product characteristic on the supply chain performance for the two different strategies. Understanding The Different Types Of Supply Chain Models.</p>
