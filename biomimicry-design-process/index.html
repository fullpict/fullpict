<h3 id="it-is-not-only-in-the-design-process-where-biomimicry-can-be-employed">It is not only in the design process where biomimicry can be employed.</h3><p>By comparing our design goals with natures functions and putting them into context we can start tapping into 38 billion years of natures strategy catalog. Ecosystem principles listed can be applied to the design process by transforming them into a set of questions that are asked of the project at each stage of the design Biomimicry Guild 2007 Charest 2007. This research paper will compare The Design Process that nature uses to that which interior designers use to solve problems. It is not only in the design process where biomimicry can be employed. This orientation is particularly true when it comes to abstracting biological strategies into more broadly applicable design principles and implementing them to. The biomimicry design process is bidirectional analogical based and interdisciplinary.</p>

There are four areas in which a biomimicry lens provides the greatest value to the design process independent of the discipline in which it is integrated. We mainly elaborate on the three core stages. The terms biomimicry and biomimetics come from the Greek words bios meaning life and mimesis meaning to imitate.

Now that you have a sense for what a biomimetic approach looks like lets consider how some of the concepts and tools of biomimicry can be integrated into other design frameworks by looking at two that are widely used in design and engineering.

<p>Processes found in nature and uses these processes to aid in the development of mankind. There are three types of biomimicry - one is copying form and shape another is copying a process like photosynthesis in a leaf and the third is mimicking at an ecosystems level like building a nature-inspired city. -Janine Benyus author of.

This study asserts that the practice of interior design should add a biomimicry phase to its design process and should biologize its design problems by using natures time-tested principles and methods. This Thesis will focus on a deep exploration of how Biomimicry has been used in the past and how it can be used to generate a sustainable response to an architectural design.

<p>Biomimicry Architecture is a technical approach to analyzing observing and taking inspiration from nature to create designs in various fields of art and architecture. The toolbox process starts with functions. Biomimicry in architecture and manufacturing is the practice of designing buildings and products that simulate or co-opt processes that occur in nature. The Biomimicry Institute defines biologize as a biomimetic approach used to evaluate design criteria 1. Without this relevant knowledge it may be difficult for any designer to create a viable solution adapted from nature. Metodo Biomimicry Bionik Bio.</p>

<p>A detailed understanding of biology is often needed for biomimicry research and design. -Energy is sourced from contemporary sunlight. Biomimicry and Engineering Design Biomimicry concepts and tools can be utilized within a variety of design processes. Teams next develop a detailed drawing showing their product or system from at least two perspectives and including a written description of how the design works. This paper argues that although designers utilize time-tested tools and methodologies ie. Biomimicry Thinking Web Design Thinking Process Design Thinking Design Theory.</p>
