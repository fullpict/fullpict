<p>It works on the principle of compression and sudden release of a tube by creating negative pressure in the tube and this vacuum created draws water from the sump. In these pumps water enters axially and is discharged by the rotor into a discharge pipe. By pedaling the bicycle the bicycle wheel rotates thereby rotating the centrifugal pump which in turns discharges water from the sump.</p>
<h3 id="the-design-is-based-on-a-successful-design-used-by-maya">The design is based on a successful design used by Maya.</h3><p>This is a centrifugal water pump which is run by rotating the pedal of a cycle. The system comprises a bicycle rim belt-pulley impeller and inlet and delivery pipes. If you like my project design please give me your precious vote. This next figure shows a typical small residential water systemThe yellow tank is an accumulator. This bicycle pedal operated pumps water. A final discussion recommends the development of a bicycle powered cable tool drilling unit to reduce the cost of drilled wells for the application of these pump units.</p>
