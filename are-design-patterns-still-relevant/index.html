<p><strong>Are Design Patterns Still Relevant</strong>, So in reality there is not a pattern of designs there is a pattern of problems.

<p>Design patterns dont really aim for functional requirements but rather for efficiency maintainability and readability. I can cite some of the popular Design Patterns implementations in the JDK and elsewhere to prove my point - Builder - javalangStringBuilderappend. There are too many design patterns to discuss them all in this post.</p>
<h3 id="and-this-brings-us-to-a-problem-with-the-term-design-pattern">And this brings us to a problem with the term Design Pattern.</h3><p>Thats just how it is in these days when everyones so busy and time is limited. It doesnt only mean the 23 that are in the book there are a lot more than that. There are many other books discussing design patterns and countless other patterns have been described and analysed. In software engineering a design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. Design patterns are simply solution patterns to common problems. The F-Pattern is one such technique that eventually informed our design and still informs how we browse dense content on the web.</p>
