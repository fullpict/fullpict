<p>The shell and tube design helps these heat exchangers withstand a wide range of pressures and temperatures. Thermal Optimization of fan assisted heat exchanger by design improvements have also been performed which has given a deep insight to a circular radiator shroud and its effects of a heat exchanger. As older facilities are upgraded or newly designed facilities are built large plate type heat exchangers are replacing tube and shell heat exchangers and becoming more common. Shell and Tube heat exchangers consist of a shell enclosing a number of tubes. Use of infra-red thermography to.
