<p>Radial-flux Motors Hold Their Own. The first IC axial engine in Europe sometimes erroneously stated to be the first ever was a on-off prototype built by Statax-Motor of Zurich Switzerland in 1913. The motorcycle concept package is a five-cylinder axial piston engine with a bore of 67mm and stroke of 56mm. Because the axial and transverse motor designs can have the rotating member located on their outer diameter they create higher torque while reducing their motor footprint. The uniqueness of the engines lies in the extremely fast adaptation to the customers needs.

<p>Axial flux motors were studied by British inventor and EV enthusiast Cedric Lynch as early as 1979. The off-set in the number of poles P16 and the number of coils C15 creates three distinct phase peaks A B and C. The potential application to motorcycle design is what sparked our interest. Axial flux motors were studied by British inventor and EV enthusiast Cedric Lynch as early as 1979. According to Nevada-based Axial Vector Energy Corporation AVEC it has powerful lightweight and highly efficient radial-design engines capable of producing significantly higher horsepower and torque with considerably lower fuel requirements than is the case.

<p>The motorcycle concept package is a five-cylinder axial piston engine with a bore of 67mm and stroke of 56mm. The internal rotating structure carries the majority of reciprocating inertial loads so the external engine. Duke re-imagined the design utilizing a reciprocator converting the linear layout into a circular or axial configurationand the results are stunning. Most of the parts are 3D printed the rotor and axle are milled. Ultimately we ended up with a double stator single rotor Axial Flux brushless motor.

<p>Duke re-imagined the design utilizing a reciprocator converting the linear layout into a circular or axial configurationand the results are stunning. The motor will be controlled by a 3 cycle. The potential application to motorcycle design is what sparked our interest. Revolutionary internal combustion engine design featuring pistons in a piston and the wave crank or axial design. Compact structure especially short axial sizes. Grogan And Company Full Details For Lot 1053 Machine A Vapeur Moteur Vapeur.</p>
