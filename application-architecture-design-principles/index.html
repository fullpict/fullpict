<p>Build redundancy into your application to avoid having single points of failure. The primary audience for this guide is solution architects and development leads. Purchase rather than Develop.</p>
<h3 id="make-all-things-redundant">Make all things redundant.</h3><p>The LCP dictates that your application have a way to read the events coming from the platform. Purchase rather than Develop. Adapt to the Blurred Application Boundaries. A design system is a large set of reusable components combined with a set of rules storing visual design information like colours or spacing and enables us to build consistent applications quickly. If a vertical line were drawn down the center of each design the left and right would be mirror images. Think Cloud When Designing Back-End Application Services.</p>
