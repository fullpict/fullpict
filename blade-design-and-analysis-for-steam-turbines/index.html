<p>PONSHANMUGAKUMAR 1 N. These tools will ensure that the technology of steam turbines will continue to improve and new ideas and innovations will. Only in isolated cases and fo r some series of small units do we find blading which is an integral part of the rotor through either welding hard soldering electrochemical machining ECM or by casting. Thus the better the design of the blade the more efficient the turbine will be. And the more efficient the turbine is.
