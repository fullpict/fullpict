<p>It is concluded that only the automated aeration system can actually cater for the dynamic nature of the composting process. This simply means that we induce airflow through the mix of materials using an electric blower - we do not turn the pile during the active phase first 30 days of composting. The pile length is divided into a series of independent aeration zones and is determined by the size of the compost facility.</p>
<h3 id="because-the-oxygen-is-more-or-less-involved-in-the-composting-process-it-is-also-called-aerated-static-pile-composting-or-aerobic-static-composting">Because the oxygen is more or less involved in the composting process it is also called aerated static pile composting or aerobic static composting.</h3><p>In the first trial 80 m3 of material was screened in one day and the probe recovery efficiency was 100. As compared to the turned windrow compost method an EASP Compost System can easily quadruple the volume of material that is composted on a given footprint resulting in the most efficient approach to managing very large volumes of material. All process air exhausts through an ECS-designed biofilter. The key design criteria of a forced aeration system include the rate of airflow cfmcy of compost the uniformity of airflow through the whole pile and the ability to intelligently adjust the airflow to control temperatures early in the process. Turned windrow - Odors isle space considerations. This simply means that we induce airflow through the mix of materials using an electric blower - we do not turn the pile during the active phase first 30 days of composting.</p>

<p>Aerated Static pile - usually placed on perforated piping providing air circulation for controlled aeration. Because the oxygen is more or less involved in the composting process it is also called aerated static pile composting or aerobic static composting. This article series examines the considerations in forced aeration static pile composting including the basics of aeration system design and operation types of aerated static pile systems and design issues to be evaluated. Aerated Static Pile Composting The method of composting that we use with all O 2 Compost Systems is referred to as Aerated Static Pile ASP Composting. The design can be used for over 500 kg of organic waste with minimal leachate to produce a soil enhancer for agricultural fields gardens andor forest land.
