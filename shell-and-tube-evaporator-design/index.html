<p>Evaporator is used in Kalina cycle with ammonia-water working fluid. A shell and tube heat exchanger is divided into two compartments. I designed a Single Effect Mechanical Vapor Compressor desalination system.</p>
<h3 id="evaporator-is-used-in-kalina-cycle-with-ammonia-water-working-fluid">Evaporator is used in Kalina cycle with ammonia-water working fluid.</h3><p>Enhancements on the outside and the inside produce exceptional performance and efficiency. Shell-and-tube type evaporators are very efficient and require minimum floor space and head space. External diameter of the heat transfer tube and mass flow rates are optimized. It is also a type of shell and tube chiller where the water runs through the tubes and the refrigerant flows over the outside of the tubes within a closed shell. Heat exchangers require approved welding procedures and our ASME certified welders combined with our design and project team are experienced to be able to meet the strict requirements of industrial heat exchangers. Mainly in the flooded chiller approximately 50 to 75 of the tubes are immersed in liquid refrigerant and the space above provides an allowance for the vapor generated through evaporation of the liquid below.</p>

<p>Condensation and evaporation were occurred in the shell side while the water was flowing in the tube side of heat exchanger. Shell and tube chillers are supplied with screwed or flanged water connections. The design of shell and tube heat exchanger using Kern method for water and steam combination is validated by well-known Dittus-Boelter equation of turbulent flow inside tube. Enhancements on the outside and the inside produce exceptional performance and efficiency. This demand is being driven by different regional energy efficiency standards such as EU Ecodesign regulation.
