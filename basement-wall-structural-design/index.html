For a well-drained granular soil a typical value for Ko 050. The minimum amount and spacing of reinforcement to be used in structural floors roof slabs and walls for control of temperature and shrinkage cracking is given in ACI 318 or in ACI 350R. The design of retaining walls may become time-consuming since the calculations involve multiple load types and combinations fixity. A typical basement retaining wall is composed of four main components. An ICF wall of slightly unusual width hence needing to be calculated is covered in the link above linked again here.</p>

<p>With residential basements I have seen lots of failures of walls designedbuilt by others. Design is for outside face at base but use on both faces for simplification. Frequently the basement walls are also laterally restrained at the base by the slab on grade so the shear key is seldom required.

<p>Structural Design of Insulating Concrete Form Walls in Residential Construction was developed as a guideline for the design of single- and multi-unit residential structures using insulating concrete form ICF wall systems. The objective of this design guide is to employ the technology efficiently. The structural engineering basement wall designs are unique in the industry that requires no vertical reinforcement and the back fill can be placed with out first floor deck being in place. In design terms basements are water-excluding structures. First forms are erected according to the structural or architectural plans.
