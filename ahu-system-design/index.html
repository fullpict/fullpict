<p>The design can be vertical or horizontal. A variable air volume VAV system AHU is designed to deliver variable volume cfm at all partial load. So the flow rate should be 24 gpm for the AHU capacity of 10 TR. Refer water system cooling load calculations for formulae and derivations. A typical AHU will have a Δt of 10 F hence we assumed the AHU coil outlet temperature as 54 F. Cleanairespecialist Com Hvac Maintenance Hvac System Design Hvac System.</p>

<p>Air handling unit AHU - Designing Buildings - Share your construction industry knowledge. A proper load calculation is important so that your system operates at maximum efficiency. A typical AHU will have a Δt of 10 F hence we assumed the AHU coil outlet temperature as 54 F. Note however the overall design of the HVAC system may place some system components outside of the confines of the AHU itself. In the Blow-Through type the fan blows the air through the mixing box filters and cooling coil before discharging them to the space being conditioned or the ducting system.
