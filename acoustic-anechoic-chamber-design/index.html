<p>AbstractThe design of a small anechoic chamber dedicated for measurements of the acoustical parameters of hi - fi loudspeaker systems is presented in the paper. Microdyne Anechoic Macrodyne Reverberation Chambers Since 1949 IAC Acoustics has designed and constructed thousands of acoustic test facilities including several hundred small anechoic and reverberation chambers. This acoustic chamber is built in such a way to minimise the level of acoustic background and acoustic waves reflected from the walls and limit the external noise. This short paper summarises the design and construction of a low cost anechoic chamber with a focus on hearing aid research. A split chamber consists of an anechoic section and a reverberant.

<p>Our engineering partner teams are designing the chamber you request. As a rule. Ad Accredited To ISO 9001 We At EEP Make Quality Our Number One Priority. In an ideal free-field environment the inverse square law would function perfectly. In order to reduce background noise the anechoic chamber was built on a box within a box principle and mounted on an isolating foundation which consisted of 50 spring vibration isolators.
