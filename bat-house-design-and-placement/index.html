<p>Research shows that it depends more on the location than the design of the bat house. Well try to place the bat box as close to the water as possible but at least 25-50 feet away from the shore.

Twelve to 20 feet off the ground is even better. How To Build A Bat House Downloadable Woodworking Plans Bat House Bat House Plans Build A Bat House.</p>
