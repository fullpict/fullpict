The Recirculating Chillers feature a compressor CFC-free refrigerant and a hot-gas by-pass valve. A water-cooled chiller removes the heat by circulating cool water through the lines in the condenser. Now lets look at how to calculate the cooling capacity of a chiller in imperial units. Chilled water systems include other HVAC equipment designed to exchange heat such as computer room air conditioners. Cooling Loops Cooling Tower Refrigeration And Air Conditioning Water Heating.</p>

<p>A chilled-water heat-exchange unit is designed to cool 5 m 3 s of air at 100 kPa and 30C to 100 kPa and 18C by using water at 8C. A chilled-water heat-exchange unit is designed to cool 5 m 3 s of air at 100 kPa and 30C to 100 kPa and 18C by using water at 8C. Regardless of who provides it the chilled water between 4 and 7 C 39-45 F is pumped through an air handler which captures the heat from the air then disperses the air throughout the area to be cooled. Full calculations are shown below. They are air-cooled water heat pump chiller no need cooling water tower at the condensing side.
