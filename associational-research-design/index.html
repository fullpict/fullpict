Research design may collect both qualitative and quantitative data but qualitative methods emphasize observations about natural behavior and artifacts that capture social life as it is experienced by the participants rather than in categories predetermined by the researcher. A positive relationship between two variables is when an increase in one variable leads to a rise in the other variable. Linear model covariational statistics presume too much about how causes and effects are inter-related to rely on for adequately informing such research so SHP needs a less presumptive and more data sensitive form of study design and data analysis the associational model.
