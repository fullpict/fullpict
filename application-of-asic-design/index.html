<p>The ability to design custom ASICs including analog or mixed-signal chips provides the designer with a great deal of freedom to optimize the design for the intended application. ASICs are usually preferred for high-level applications. Power dissipation is becoming the most challenging design constraint in nanometer technologies.</p>

ASICs are silicon chips designed for a very specific purpose created to perform a repeated function very effectively as opposed to. Atmel customers must sign off a design to confirm that it complies with all the recom-mendations in the Atmel ASIC Design Guidelines.
