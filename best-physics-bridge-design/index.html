<p>A beam bridge needs to be stiff. My bridge was 20 inches long 160 grams and held 4287 pounds. Bridge building took a great leap forward in the 19th century as engineers in Europe and the United States applied the principles of physics to erect some of the best-known bridges the world has ever seen.

<p>The diagonal structural beams slope toward the bridge center while Pratt truss utilizes diagonal beams that slope outward from the center of the bridge. They work in tandem like a regular truss with struts that connect the upper arches to the lower archs. Physics is a field of science that studies matter energy forces and more.

<p>Please note that the sides of the bridge will be longer because of the slope. There are lots of different types of beam bridges. Modern bridges such as the Hangzhou Bay Bridge owe much to structures that preceded them. Make the top chord of the bridge thicker by drawing the a second and third lines to product the shape of 1-3 sticks. A beam bridge can take great weight over a short distance truss bridges take advantage of the strength of the shape of a triangle while suspension bridges can handle torque and tension across a long distance.
