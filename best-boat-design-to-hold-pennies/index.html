<p>The best design for an aluminum foil boat would be to try tomake it cover as much area as possible. Using the foil everyone has 10 minutes to create a boat with a flat surface on the bottom see pictures for some ideas. Brainstorm with your group to design a shape from the clay that you think will float and hold the most weight.</p>
<h3 id="you-can-test-these-other-boats-in-same-way-by-adding-pennies-or-small-objects">You can test these other boats in same way by adding pennies or small objects.</h3><p>THINK what design do you think will work best. Index cards paper coffee filters etc. Record your results so you can work out which is the best boat. Once the boat is placed in the water they may not use their hands or anything else to touch the boat and hold the pennies on it. Flatten the aluminum foil and dry it. Measure the mass of 10 pennies.</p>
