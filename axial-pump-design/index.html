<p>Centrifugal pumps can be classified based on the manner in which fluid flows through the pump. However a good efficiency and a technically reasonable pump size for high volume capacities and low heads can only be achieved with axial pumps.

<p>In this design calculated value of specific speed based on required head and capacity is 877 rpm and it is within the range of high specific speed pump that is 400 and 1200. In general the swash plate design is used for pumps and the bent axis design for motors although there are applications where this is not the best solution. A mixed flow pump with an adjustable geometry nozzle is probably an easier more reliable way to get the same performance flexibility. The manner in which fluid flows through the pump is determined by the design of the pump casing and the impeller. This is because the traditional guide vane is fixed on the guide vane hub with a fixed angle for the design condition and cannot be adjustable with the change in working conditions.

<p>Our Axial Flow and Turbine Pump design have the ability to pump fluids at high volume with low horsepower needs. There can be extensive overlap in. As a general rule axial flow pumps are usually selected for pumping large volumes of water against relatively low heads 115 m. For large-diameter propellers normally manufactured for operation in air the maximum design velocity should be less than about 10 msec because the propeller hib is designed for stresses related to high-speed low-resistance operation.

<p>FPI axial flow large volume pumps are custom designed and engineered to obtain the most efficient operation for each installation and are regularly offered in sizes ranging from 8 inches through 72 inches and capacities of 1000 gallons per minute to 120000 gallons per minute in low and medium heads. So axial flow pump type that is high specific speed pump is chosen in this study. One criterion for the design is the specific. The manner in which fluid flows through the pump is determined by the design of the pump casing and the impeller.

<p>When the axial-flow pump is working under off-design condition the attack angle which causes hydraulic loss will always exist at the leading edge of the guide vane. The fluid is pushed in a direction parallel to the shaft of the impeller in course of their flow through the pump do not change their radial. They are generally the pump of choice for flows over 5Lmin and up to 415 bar if budgets allow. However a good efficiency and a technically reasonable pump size for high volume capacities and low heads can only be achieved with axial pumps.

<p>However a good efficiency and a technically reasonable pump size for high volume capacities and low heads can only be achieved with axial pumps. Our Axial Flow and Turbine Pump design have the ability to pump fluids at high volume with low horsepower needs. This lead was followed by other factories that endeavoured to become leading manufacturers of centrifugal pump design and after this the design of helicoidal diagonal and axial flow pumps was developed rapidly. An axial flow pump with variable pitch is one choice. This family of pumps is specifically designed for low-head movement of water for a multitude of municipal agricultural and industrial services.

<p>They are generally the pump of choice for flows over 5Lmin and up to 415 bar if budgets allow. A wide range of geometric tools and interactive charts allows users to configure the axial pumps blades easily and in a short time of time. The three types of flow through a centrifugal pump are radial flow axial flow and mixed flow. For large-diameter propellers normally manufactured for operation in air the maximum design velocity should be less than about 10 msec because the propeller hib is designed for stresses related to high-speed low-resistance operation.

<p>An axial piston pump has a number of pistons usually an odd number arranged in a circular array within a housing which is commonly referred to as a cylinder block rotor or barrelThis cylinder block is driven to rotate about its axis of symmetry by an integral shaft that is more or less aligned with the pumping pistons usually parallel but not necessarily. There can be extensive overlap in. A mixed flow pump with an adjustable geometry nozzle is probably an easier more reliable way to get the same performance flexibility. So axial flow pump type that is high specific speed pump is chosen in this study. It has an impeller inside the pipe.
