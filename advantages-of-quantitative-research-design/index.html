<p>Disadvantages of Quantitative research. You can also compare its results. Qualitative Research has a more real feel as it deals with human experiences and observations.</p>
<h3 id="the-samples-of-quantitative-research-are-randomized">The samples of quantitative research are randomized.</h3><p>The quantitative approach allows you to reach a higher sample size. There are four main types of quantitative research designs. It is worth knowing that since qualitative and quantitative research approaches are based on divergent theories and assumptions one should be more advantageous than the other and vice versa depending on the nature of research and data collection methods. Quantitative research methods on the other hand involve a larger sample and do not require relatively a longer time for data collection. Allows you to reach a higher sample size. Quantitative researchers aim to create a general understanding of behavior and other phenomena across different settings and populations.</p>
