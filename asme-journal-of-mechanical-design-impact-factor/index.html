<h3 id="journal-of-mechanical-design---transactions-of-the-asme">Journal of Mechanical Design - Transactions of the ASME.</h3><p>As of 2007 the JIF values and other similar measures of impact are available at ISI for 6417 journal titles. The Journal also publishes technical briefs design innovation papers discussions of published papers with rebuttal book reviews and editorials. JMD has traditionally served the ASME Design Engineering Division and its technical committees but it welcomes contributions from all areas of design with an emphasis on design synthesis. The Journal of Mechanisms and Robotics JMR was established by Professor Mike McCarthy of the University of California in 2009 to provide a forum for the evolving robotics sub-disciplines that fall outside of the scope of the ASME mechanical design publication. The Journal of Mechanical Design was originally published as the Journal of Mechanisms Transmissions and Automation in Design ISSN. The impact score IS 2020 of Journal of Electronic Packaging Transactions of the ASME is 184 which is computed in 2021 as per its definitionJournal of Electronic Packaging Transactions of the ASME IS is decreased by a factor of 009 and approximate percentage change is -466 when compared to preceding year 2019 which shows a falling trend.</p>
