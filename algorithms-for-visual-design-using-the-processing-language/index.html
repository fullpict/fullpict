<p>Generative Art is a process of algorithmically generating new ideas forms shapes colors or patterns. First you create rules that provide boundaries for the creation process. We employed the concept of Space Syntax to evaluate the solutions by calculating the integration value for each space from spatial connectivity in a building Fig. As the first book to share the necessary algorithms for creating code to experiment with design problems in the processing language this book offers a series of generic procedures that can function as building blocks and encourages you to then use those building blocks to. More information on using Processing itself is can be found in the environment section of the reference.

<p>Processing uses the Java language with additional simplifications such as additional classes and aliased. Use a flow chart to design an algorithm that includes branching and iteration. The authors approach comes out of architecture with a focus on spatialization surface texture solid geometry 3D space movement with introductions to texture generating algorithms such as Voronoi tesselations stochastic search fractals cellular automata and genetic algorithms.
