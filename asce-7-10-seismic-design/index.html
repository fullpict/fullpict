<p>This is due to a penalty imposed by ASCE 7-16 for Site Class D sites in seismically active areas as well as updates to site amplification factors based on recent research. Damping of SFRS modified by damping devices. Under the new ASCE 7-16 standard using a Site Class D response spectrum for the same building will result in a 60 to 80 percent increase in seismic demand relative to ASCE 7-10.
