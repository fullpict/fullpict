<p>A plate type heat exchanger as illustrated in Figure 2 consists of plates instead of tubes to separate the hot and cold fluids. Furthermore copper has lower flexibility than aluminium making it more difficult to form into certain shapesBecause of this design engineers working on a plate fin exchanger which is a type of heat exchanger that uses plates and finned chambers to transfer heat between fluids might find that aluminium is a better fit for the fins. It focuses on plate-fin heat exchangers which are predominantly used in aerospace manufacturing and building services because they are durable efficient lightweight and compact. The overall heat exchanger design methodology would normally include thermal design mechanical design and manufacturing consideration for the specific application.
