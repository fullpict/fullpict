<p>And from this reconstruction came most of the gothic features that we see in the abbey such as the pointed arches ribbed vaulting rose windows and flying buttresses. Sir Giles Gilbert Scott the architect behind the last major work carried out there in the 1870s called it a structure perfect in itselfPhotograph. John James his successor as Surveyor finished the work. Finally the most recent and no wonder the most significant addition to the Abbey since 1745 is the West Tower designed by Ptolemy Dean Architects. Arguably one of the most recognizable buildings in England the Collegiate Church of St. Pin On Ceilings.</p>
