Barge had to be in part submerged some 55 metres below surface to allow the buoy to be floated onto it thereafter be skidded from barge to shore and vice versa. 23 The guidelines and calculation methods set out in this report represent the views of Noble Denton and are considered to be sound and in accordance with offshore industry practice. Analysis procedures developed in the present study can be integrated into the current vessel impact design foundation given by the. Dock Flotation Rule of Thumb. Max prop dia 80cm.</p>
