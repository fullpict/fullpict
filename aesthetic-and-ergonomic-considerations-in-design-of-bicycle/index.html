The contact between the product and the people arises due to the sheer necessity of this functional requirement. Ergonomics involves the use of design methods and principle data to optimize the overall performance of human beings and integrated systems Green Jordan 1999. This evaluation involved the control of the geometry and dimension of the bicycles frames as well as the control of the permissible adjustment range. After that the intelligent system could be used again to advice the user which redesign changes are possible to improve the ergonomic andor aesthetic value of the product if applicable. It has to perform specific functions to the satisfaction of customer.</p>

<p>Department of Industrial and Operations Engineering University of Michigan Ann Arbor MI 48109-2117 USA. Widespread use of bicycles necessitates the design should match the anthropometric data to be ergonomic. This evaluation involved the control of the geometry and dimension of the bicycles frames as well as the control of the permissible adjustment range. However increasingly the boundaries between the two disciplines are disappearing and ergonomists are taking some responsibility for the aesthetics of the design using scientific methods to increase understanding of the aesthetics both pleasurable and displeasurable and applying this to the design of products. In the present study the ergonomic evaluation of the design of a series of child bicycles produced by a major Greek bicycle manufacturer based on Greek children anthropometric data is presented.
