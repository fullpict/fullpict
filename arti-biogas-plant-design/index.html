It is estimated that 2000 ARTI biogas digesters have been built. The composition and the properties of the biogas are given in the following table 11 and 12 Table 11 Composition of biogas Name of the gas Composition in biogas Methane CH4 50-70 Carbon dioxide CO2 30-40 Hydrogen H2 5-10 Nitrogen N2 1-2 Water vapour H2O 03 Hydrogen sulphide H2S Traces 4 DESIGN ANALYSIS OF PORTABLE BIOGAS PLANT USING KITCHEN WASTE 2014 Table 12.

<p>ARTI has developed a compact biogas plant which uses waste food rather than manure as feedstock to supply biogas for cooking. Biogas or Gobar Gas Plant is design by Appropriate rural of technology institute ARTI India this biogas digester made by two 1000 and 750 liter Plastic water tank one is called Digester or fermenter tank other is called gas holder tank or movable domeI am sharing on Pakistan Science clubs web for educational and promotional purpose we hope its will helps Pakistani people and PSCs. The standard plant uses two tanks with volumes of typically 075 m3 and 1 m3 750l and. The plant is sufficiently comact to be used by urban households and about 2000 are currently in use both in urban and rural households in Maharashtra.

<p>The design and development of this simple yet powerful technology for the people has won ARTI the Ashden Award for Sustainable Energy 2006 in the Food Security category. About 2500 of these biogas plants are currently in use in Maharashtra Müller 2007. Two test sites are also used to verify further improvements such as the design of gas. This is a proven design that has been in use for decades with thousands of such systems having been built. The plants are made from conventional polythene water tanks two tanks with volumes of typically 075 m3and 1 m3 MUELLER 2007 and standard plumber piping.
