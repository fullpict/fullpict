<p>The AC45 Class Has been created as a bridge to the new AC72. It has only two mobile profiles while 24 years ago the catamaran Stars Stripes had a wing fitted with a trailing edge steerable on the profile support. I could create full size paper templates that one could use to cut out the hull forms as well as the wing. Screen grab from Membrain design software showing an inverted head of a hard wing sail. Performance team manager Ian Fresh Burns shares how the teams AC45 sails are. Interactive Graphic High Tech On The High Seas Los Angeles Times Americas Cup Catamaran Yacht Sailing.</p>

<p>I dont know what the design approach was for the AC45 sections. Screen grab from Membrain design software showing an inverted head of a hard wing sail. The sections for the AC72 were intended to maintain longer runs of laminar flow if laminar flow could be obtained without incurring any significant penalties in drag or maximum lift over a fully turbulent design if laminar flow could not. This is a Wing Sail Catamaran project that I started over 6 years ago after seeing the new AC 45s introduced to the Americas Cup races.

<p>By inverting the upper wing the sailwing is actually pushing backwards. I could create full size paper templates that one could use to cut out the hull forms as well as the wing. Identical boats are being built for each team who will train and race them in the 2011-12 and 2012-13 Americas Cup World Series seasons. The sections for the AC72 were intended to maintain longer runs of laminar flow if laminar flow could be obtained without incurring any significant penalties in drag or maximum lift over a fully turbulent design if laminar flow could not. It takes a monumental team effort to design and build the winged sails that grace the AC45 and AC72.
