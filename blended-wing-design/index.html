<p>The Blended Wing Body BWB is a tailless design that integrates the wing and the fuselage and was initially conceived towards the end of the 20th century to serve as a novel platform for high-speed subsonic commercial airliners In the general case it consists of a middle section center body or fuselage and an outer section wing whereas the part in between is the blending area where. Design and experimental validation of a specialized pressure-measuring rake for blended wing body aircrafts unconventional inner flow channel 6 July 2020 Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers Part G.

<p>This design remained very similar but the aerodynamics was altered. Blended Wing Body BWB is an idea where the fuselage of an aircraft blends with the wing and tail forming a hybrid shape that resembles a flying wing 1. Researches have shown that this design concept offers a significant improvement in the aerodynamic efficiency yet the concept has to be developed for the commercial transport aircrafts. This provides a means of designing planes requiring tightly coupled technologies. This configuration incorporates design features from conventional fuselage as well as traditional flying wing.

<p>The exceptionally wide fuselage opens up multiple options for hydrogen storage and distribution and for cabin layout. Answer 1 of 3. A blended-wing body design up to 200 passengers concept in which the wings merge with the main body of the aircraft with a range similar to that of the turbofan concept. The blended wing body design continued to be evaluated the design requirements changed slightly by reducing the passenger count to 468 passengers and increasing the range to 7750nm this aircraft was called the BWB 450 Ordoukhanian Madni 2014. This configuration incorporates design features from conventional fuselage as well as traditional flying wing.
