The main focus of mechanism design is on on the design of institutions that satisfy certain objectives assuming that the individuals interacting through the institution will act strategically and may hold. The theory of mechanism design seeks to study the general structure underlying all these applications but it also considers a number of particularly prominent applications in detail.</p>
