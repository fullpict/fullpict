The increasing use of quasi-experimental research designs QEDs in education brought into focus following the credibility revolution Angrist Pischke 2010 in economics which sought to use data to empirically test theoretical assertions has indeed improved causal claims in education Loeb et al 2017. The intervention can be a training program a policy change or a medical treatment. Quasi-experimental research offers the benefit of comparison between groups. ADVANTAGES Quasi experimental designs are more frequently used because they are more practical and feasible to conduct research. In a typical quasi-experimental design two classes may be selected a pretest given to both and then the program or treatment that is given to the experimental group.</p>

Unlike a true experiment in a quasi-experimental study the choice of who gets the intervention and who doesnt is not randomized. Quasi-experiments have lower internal validity than true experiments but they often have higher external validity as they can use real-world interventions instead of artificial laboratory settings.
