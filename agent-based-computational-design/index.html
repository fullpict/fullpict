<p>This study develops an agent-based computational economics ACE framework to explore experimentally how a Treasury should auction its securities. Agent-based computational economics ACE is the area of computational economics that studies economic processes including whole economies as dynamic systems of interacting agentsAs such it falls in the paradigm of complex adaptive systems. Because trade and give involve a form of interaction between the agents they run over several sub-rounds. Buyers are modeled as profit seekers capable of submitting strategic bids via reinforcement learning. Satoru Sugihara embodies here a new generation of architectural practice developing new conceptual programming tools in order to script and process complex s.

<p>Models in the realm of agent-based computational ï¬nance view ï¬nancial markets as interacting groups of learning boundedly-rational agents. Buyers are modeled as profit seekers capable of submitting strategic bids via reinforcement learning. Create destroy trade and give. Agent-based modelling is a way to model the dynamics of complex systems and complex adaptive systems. Such systems often self-organize themselves and create emergent order.

One branch of this work has come to be known as agent-based computational economics ACE the computational study of economies modeled as evolving systems of autonomous interacting agents1 ACE researchers rely on computational frameworks to study the evolution of decentralized market economies under controlled experimental conditions.
