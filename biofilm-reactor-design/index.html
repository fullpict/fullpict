<p>The latter approach results in the mathematical biofilm models being no more useful than the empirical design criteria and formulations that have been historically applied to biofilm reactor design. In order to overcome these operational problems the compact and innovative moving bed biofilm reactor MBBR was designed.

<p>Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor Technology. The latter approach results in the mathematical biofilm models being no more useful than the empirical design criteria and formulations that have been historically applied to biofilm reactor design. Ad We design and build laboratory reactors for growing and testing biofilms. Reactor and process design considerations for these reactors are reviewed. Moving bed biofilm reactor MBBR is a type of wastewater treatment process that was first invented by Prof. Mbbr Carrier Koi Pond Bio Filter Media Fluidized Bed Water Treatment Filters.</p>
