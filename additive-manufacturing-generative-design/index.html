<p>Most generative design programs dont consider how the part will be manufactured so engineers must still use design for additive manufacturing DFAM principles to help create a better part that would reduce or eliminate the need for supports a process that requires a detailed understanding of the manufacturing process. Improve a parts performance by letting the computer explore the entire design space. If additive manufacturing were a door to the automotive future generative design would be the key to unlock it.

<p>Read an overview in our Figure 3. I am starting to use Generative Design within Fusion360 and have some seemingly strange behaviour happening with the additive manufacturing method. If the set current view as or part orientation is changed does Fusion360 use the updated co-ordinates for the generative design orientation. Its not hard to understand why. Each has its own strengths but together they are formidable.

<p>If additive manufacturing were a door to the automotive future generative design would be the key to unlock it. While this isnt the first instance of generative design or of additive manufacturing being used in machine parts it is one of the first times they have been used in a high-end consumer product. If the set current view as or part orientation is changed does Fusion360 use the updated co-ordinates for the generative design orientation. 3-axis left and 25-axis. Its not hard to understand why.

<p>MSC Apex Generative Design engineers parts instead of designing them reducing design time for additive manufactured parts by as much as 80 according to the company. AM technology enables better parts if the designer can take advantage of its abilities at this stage. The design representing such a dramatic improvement on its traditionally-designed predecessors clearly demonstrates the capabilities and possibilities of these. Generative Design Additive Manufacturing Axis. The system optimized the two designs on the left for 3-axis milling and cast aluminum.
