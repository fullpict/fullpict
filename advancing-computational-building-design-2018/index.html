<p>We shape the next generation of design and architecture talents. NEXT 20 takes the next step taking cues from the inaugural conference and expands to bring forth collaborative workshops guest lectures on Advanced Computational Design a showcase of inter-disciplinary approaches by renowned experts and personal interactions through panel discussions revolving around Emerging Technologies in. Parametric Facade Reference Facade Amano Design Office Architect Yoshihiro Amano came up with the design for the Dear Jingumae Building after being asked to give the existing structure a new frontage that would allow it to stand out from its neighbors. Computational design allows designers to program the behaviour of a complex architectural system such as the building facades. 2018 Apr 86 4742-746.
