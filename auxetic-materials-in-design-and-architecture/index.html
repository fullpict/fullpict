<p>Auxetic materials are characterized by the uncommon capacity of extending sideways when pulled longitudinally while contracting laterally under compressive action. Auxetic Structures are a class of meta-materials uniquely characterised by their Negative Poissons Ratio thus when a lateral force is applied the structure expands longitudinally becoming thicker and stronger perpendicular to the strain. Auxetic structures are fabricated by additive manufacturing soft lithography machining technology compressed foaming and textile fabrication using various biomaterials including poly ethylene glycol diacrylate polyurethane poly lactic-glycolic acid chitosan hydroxyapatite and using a hard material such as a silicon wafer.

<p>F there are also many other industrial applications that chiral metamaterials should be employed such as. Auxetic structures are also being tested to use in architecture reating structures that can be installed in an instant in disaster relief areas. Examples of auxetic structures. Re-entrant hexagonal REH and helical auxetic yarn HAY were adopted as a macro fabric structure and weft yarn to produce three kinds of auxetic fabrics. It covers from large-scale structures right down to the nanoscale and it spans the classic categories of polymers composites metals and ceramics.

<p>Auxetic structures are also being tested to use in architecture reating structures that can be installed in an instant in disaster relief areas. Auxetic materials are characterized by the uncommon capacity of extending sideways when pulled longitudinally while contracting laterally under compressive action. Examples of auxetic structures. Our contribution is to derive new principles for auxetic design from the geometric theory of auxetic deformations recently introduced in 6. Design and materials science 681418.
