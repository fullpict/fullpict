UFC 3-260-02 Pavement Design for Airfields. Most concrete airfield pavement design procedures are based on developing sufficient slab thicknesses to resist fatigue cracking that is structural cracking caused by repeated load applications at stress levels less than the ultimate static strength of the concrete. Most concrete airfield pavement design procedures are based on developing sufficient slab thicknesses to resist fatigue cracking that is structural cracking caused by repeated load applications at stress levels less than the ultimate static strength of the concrete. The fatigue model plays an important role in the mechanisticempirical design procedure of airfield pavement. The elastic layered analysis for rigid pavements covers only plain concrete reinforced concrete and concrete overlay pavements.</p>
