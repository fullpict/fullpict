Based on the results as the contact time and pH increase the removal efficiency of ammonia increases which showed the effect of these two important factors on the efficiency of ammonia removal through air stripping. The presence of ammonia in wastewater can be found in two forms namely ammonium ions and ammonia gas. The air stripper shell was fabricated from FRP and was supplied with a centrifugal blower was designed to produce 1875cfm at 25 wc. A sensitivity analysis was also done to make sure the column could withstand changing conditions like temperature and contaminant concentration.

<p>Many studies have recommended an air-to-water flow ratio of 30001 to remove ammonium ions The aim of this study was to investigate the efficiency of the stripping process for ammonium ion removal with air to water ratios of less than 30001The results of this study show that the air-to-water flow ratio is as low as 60. Air stripping efficiency is limited by the volatility of the contaminant Volatility tendency of a compound to evaporate under normal atmospheric conditions More likely to become gas when more volatile Extremely efficient at removing volatile organic compounds VOCs Can be used for semi-volatile compounds with. The presence of ammonia in wastewater can be found in two forms namely ammonium ions and ammonia gas. Types of aeration methods include packed towers diffused aeration tray aeration and spray aeration. Designed and fabricated 1 one 9-0 Diameter x 29-0 high air stripping tower to treat 70gpm of Ammonia contaminated water at the Coey Tanning Company factory in Wartrace TN.
