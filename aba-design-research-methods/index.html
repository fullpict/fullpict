Research methods in applied behavior analysis introduces the reader to behaviour analysis and its purpose. While most published psychological research is based on between group research designs ABA typically examines behavior at the level of the individual and generally utilizes single-case research designs SCD thus permitting a scientifically valid conclusion to be drawn from the intensive investigation of an individual Blampied 1999.
