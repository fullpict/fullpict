<p>Reasons for Adaptive Designs in Medical Device Studies Sample size re-estimation Initial sample size based on highly uncertain effectiveness of device or control eg from feasibility or historical studies. Known as adaptive design the method can minimize clinical trial sponsors resource requirements and increase chances of study success. Evaluation of medical imaging devices often involves clinical studies where multiple readers MR read images of multiple cases MC for a clinical task which are often called MRMC studies.</p>
<h3 id="the-faster-path-to-market">The faster path to market.</h3><p>Key study design components can be adapted throughout the trial. Evaluation of medical imaging devices often involves clinical studies where multiple readers MR read images of multiple cases MC for a clinical task which are often called MRMC studies.
