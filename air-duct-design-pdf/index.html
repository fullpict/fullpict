<p><strong>Air Duct Design Pdf</strong>, Thus it is necessary to design the air duct system in such a way that the capital cost of ducts and the cost of running the fans is lower. This reduction also improves the air flow characteristics at the branch ducts that are closest to the air-handling unitThe 50 rule is demonstrated in Figure 5 on the next pageNote that at the start of the plenum there is an available air volume of 1200 cfm and an available velocity of 900 ftmin. High-velocity HV duct systems are characterized by air velocities in the range of 2500 to 3500 fpm.</p>
