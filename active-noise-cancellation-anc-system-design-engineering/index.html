<p>It leverages active noise cancellation and gains maximum advantage from the move toward software-based acoustics. There is basically a sensor which detects. Active noise cancellation ANC is a system or technique of applying an anti-noise waveform which closely matches the shape and frequency of the offending noise waveform at an angle of precisely 180 degrees out of phase from the noise at the.
