It was designed around people ensuring optimum view comfortable seats and maximum enjoyment of sporting events. The concept behind the Beijing National Stadium was born from old Chinese art with woven lines around a circular vessel. A master plan concept design was developed for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games to establish a clear organizational structure for the entire site and create a significant place in the plan for the National Stadium.
