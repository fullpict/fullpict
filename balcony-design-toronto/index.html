<p>For the floor we only use balcony floor. Most balconies come with plain ol concrete which is hardly inviting. Bedroom balconies are popular in houses with a lot of open space around. Though at least an exercise machine is usable in winter. We specialize in Balconies design and balcony railings installation.
