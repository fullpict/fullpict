It is widely used and has been shown to be effective for improving specific skills and decreasing problem behaviors. Reversal designs are particularly useful for the evaluation of medication effects because they provide additional information about the effectiveness of treatment. Single-subject research is a group of research methods that are used extensively in the experimental analysis of behavior and applied behavior analysis with both human and non-human participants.

Drawbacks to ABAB and reversal designs are ethical concerns and the irreversibility of certain targets. Single-subject research is a group of research methods that are used extensively in the experimental analysis of behavior and applied behavior analysis with both human and non-human participants. ABA design also known as a withdrawal or reversal design is a type of single subject experimental design which allows researchers to investigate the effectiveness of an intervention. The A-B-A-B design is recommended for use when reversal designs can be used and when the patients treatment phase needs to be maintained.

The study by Hall and his colleagues was an ABAB reversal design. Additionally many clinicianseducators prefer the ABAB design because the investigation ends with a treatment phase rather than the absence of an intervention. For example it might be used to establish a functional relationship between the use of the plural form of a noun and a treatment such as praise following the occurrence of a plural noun. Ace Lab.</p>
