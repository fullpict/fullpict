Legitimate options for a secure hurricane-resistant building include clay and concrete roof tiles or increasingly metal roofs which are designed to withstand the pressure caused by high winds. The objective of this document is to provide rural households with clear guidance regarding earthquake resistant construction techniques and to support them to have house designs in compliance with the National Building Code of Nepal. First is to make sure youre building your home in a place where the soil beneath is firm and solid. The engineer architect and the knowledge of the professional handling the project has to use his creativity and engineering skills to create a home in style shape and design which will keep the structure safe and secured during earthquake and other catastrophic events and accidents. It is important for a country like India with a burgeoning urban population to adopt strict measures for constructing earthquake proof buildings.</p>
