The ideal size of an air receiver tank will depend on the type of air compressor and. Maximum permissible switching cycles per hour of the largest switching compressor. Most air receivers will show a minimum design metal temperature MDMT of -20F on the nameplate. I think Akendewa does not required ASME U stamp for his air receiver but need to stamp the design construction code on this vessel for infomation only.
