<p>A design guide and general reference for engineers and upper-level students involved in the specification analysis design development and compliance of aircraft flight control actuation systems though also useful for other types of hydraulic actuation systems. The conventional and distributed flight actuation system design considered the redundancy of systems and actuators and also the relationship of the power control channel and actuator work mode. Aircraft control systems have evolved. Introduction1 The architecture of aircraft actuation system is a collection of control surfaces flight control computers FCCs power sources and actuators which is organ- ized in a certain form. This has several advantages. Pin On Aero Modelos.</p>
