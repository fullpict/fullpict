<p>The booklet stresses the fact that building a shelter may not be the best solution in every situation and suggests some alternative projects to consider see Section 1. The Association of Shelter Veterinarians ASV compiled the Guidelines for Standards of Care in Animal Shelters to provide research-based guidelines that will help any sheltering operation meet the physical medical and behavioral needs of the animals in their care. It should provide a safe and healthy environment for both animals and the people who care for them. Designing for pets in a no-kill shelter requires greater sensitivity to the needs of the animals as they may stay awhile before finding a home. Animal shelter must be a place of security and comfort for the animals sheltered there. Library University Of Wisconsin Madison Shelter Medicine Program.</p>
