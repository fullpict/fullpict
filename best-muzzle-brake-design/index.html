<p>The best 308 muzzle brake for most people. I put one on my SSG-69 and like it a lot. It will be know as The Muzzle Brake We have done back to back tests with a few others and this brake is going to be my new favorite. The engineers at the Armys Benét Laboratories in Watervliet New York have begun using CFD computational fluid dynamics to model the guns recoil forces and blast pressures for different muzzle brake designs to provide optimized solutions of low recoil force with acceptable blast overpressure. These will only partially reduce flash seen from 3 and 9 oclock but do a better job as seen from 12 oclock. Pin On Hunting Gear.</p>

<p>I put one on my SSG-69 and like it a lot. CST is honored to have the opportunity to work with Superior Shooting Systems developing a new muzzle brake to compliment and enhance the new Tubb Adaptive Target Rifle. This design is more effective than the Radial Brake at reducing felt recoil but directs a greater blast back towards the shooter from the angled side ports. Hightech products from Switzerland that are unique and absolutely unmatched in their field. Due to this the material is one of the key features. Pin On Muzzlebrake2017.</p>
