<p>L3Harris AT-741 Series L-band Blade Antennas utilize a new concept of antenna design and manufacture which makes them ideal for commercial and military application. Blade antennas are preferred antenna structures in airborne applications due to their light weight and aerodynamic shape. As it can be observed from the measurement results the proposed antennas return loss characteristic is less than -6db and has a gain characteristic of 45-62 dB over the operation. A good way to understand the quality of impedance matching in this case to 50 Ω is to study the reflection coefficient of the antenna. Aluminium as the material because of its light.

<p>These thin line high velocity blades have a forward direction width of only 18. These thin line high velocity blades have a forward direction width of only 18. Blade Antennas The Haigh-Farr family of rugged Blade antennas is available in frequencies ranging from UHF to upper C-band and may be provided in either straight or rounded blade configurations. The antenna design is accomplished using parametric analysis in the HFSS software where the antenna dimensions are changed and it is observed how the changes affect figures-of-merit like input impedance reflection coefficient and. This antenna is suitable for various communication applications on supersonic and subsonic aerodynes with fixed wing or rotor wing. Geometry Of The Blade Antenna Download Scientific Diagram.</p>

<p>S25B102-C0 is a vertically polarized low profile UHF broadband blade antenna designed for omni-directional transmission and reception in the frequency band of 225-400MHz. Jahoda Astron Wireless Technology Inc. Operating within frequencies between 1500 to 4700 MHz this antenna is optimized for the L S and C-band downlinks with low drag operationsA magnetic mount or tubular chassis mounting assembly. The total distance of the petal or wire loop should be equal to one wavelength this is the distance A1-A2-A3-A4. The dual band type uses a plane and slot design to get efficient omni-directional coverage so that it can operate on two different radio.
