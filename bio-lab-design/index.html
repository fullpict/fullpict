Laboratory facility designers may be necessary to accommodate other hazards ie biological radiological and physical hazards not considered in this docu-ment. Design doors hallways and aisles of sufficient width for standard lab carts and equipment moves. Safety and Infection control 7. As such protective measures for these other hazards that might be encoun-tered in laboratories must be based on a comprehensive hazard and risk analysis. Basic Laboratory Design for Biosafety Levels 1 and 2 Containment facilities are described in the CDCNIH publication Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories BMBL and in the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic.</p>
