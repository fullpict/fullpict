<p>What is an aggregate. Sure its a pattern thats central to domain-driven design but is it just a collection of objects. In the context of building applications DDD talks about problems as domains.

<p>It prefers domains over interface. All communication via JDBC uses the PGobject type to carry the JSON payload to and from the database. It could also be that the join table is an aggregate of its own the relationship between user and role being a thing that has a life cycle of its own possibly with its own rules. This supports remove removeAll save and saveAll in the concrete sub-classes. Domain Driven DesignDDD suggests to group related objects as Aggregates and to use Factories and Repositories to manage the lifecycle of the object.

<p>In other words the join table gets a representation in your domain model. Aggregate Roots in Domain-Driven Design Aggregate Root interface in C public interface IAggregateRoot. If we are used to designing our domain models by using a relational model then trying to shove that into a document database will pose many many issues. Vaughn Vernon author of Implementing Domain-Driven Design explains how crucial it is to follow the Aggregate Rules of Thumb when designing Aggregates. Creating and working with well-designed aggregates is one of the least well understood tactical patterns found in Domain-Driven Design Vaughn.
