<p>Ball Check Valves are simple and compact and commonly used on small water or wastewater pumps where economy is important. Fluid flowing to the right will push the ball bearing against the spring and open the valve to permit flow. A Ball Check Valve consists of a threaded or flanged body with internal features that guide a rubbercoated ball in and out of the seat as the flow goes forward and reverse.</p>

I used Algor to do the CFD and found it necessary to restrict the flow up to 60 GPM into the face of the ball or the flow speed and pressure at the ball face would cause the oil to burn.

Ball valve design in which the ball is not rigidly held on its rotational axis is free to float between the seat rings. In the closed position ball is pushed against the seat by the pressure of the fluid from upstream and hence can pressure seal the downstream of the valve. The spring tension forces the plunger into its seat keeping the check valve closed.</p>

<p>In some designs the body itself is split into two sections that bolt together. Like valve bodies bonnets vary in design. Although manufacturers claim their check valves are leak-free in one direction of flow and allow free flow in the reverse direction a tiny scratch wear mark or imperfection on the poppet or scat will permit some leakage.
