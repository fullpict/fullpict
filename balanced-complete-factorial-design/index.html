<p>Seeing as how the block size in this case is fixed we can achieve a balanced complete block design by adding more replicates so that lambda equals at least 1. Factorial design two-level fractional factorial design randomized complete block design and split-plot design. The balance means that all differences between treatments are measured with equal precision. When the data is balanced the data points are distributed over the experimental region so that they have an equal contribution to the parameter estimates. If equal sample sizes are taken for each of the possible factor combinations then the design is a balanced two-factor factorial design.

<p>The thoroughness of this approach however makes it quite expensive and time-consuming. One of the big advantages of factorial designs is that they allow researchers to look for interactions between independent variables. A 22 factorial design is a type of experimental design that allows researchers to understand the effects of two independent variables each with two levels on a single dependent variable. For example a complete factorial design is both orthogonal and balanced if in fact the model that includes all possible interactions is correct.

<p>Although many designs satisfy both criteria some such as Central Composite designs forego design balance in favor of data. Full Factorial Design leads to experiments where at least one trial is included for all possible combinations of factors and levels. In statistics a full factorial experiment is an experiment whose design consists of two or more factors each with discrete possible values or levels and whose experimental units take on all possible combinations of these levels across all such factors. The balance means that all differences between treatments are measured with equal precision. For example factors A and B might be run 10 times for two levels.
