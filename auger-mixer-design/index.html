Tmr Vertical Mixer Fatmix From valmetal.valmetal.com</p>
<p>An auger for a vertical livestock feed mixer having an open-top mixing tub is provided. The trailing edge of the upper auger flight includes an upraised portion to deflect feed components towards the sidewalls of the feed mixer. The design of the screw is based on the theory of the inclined plane.</p>
<h3 id="our-mission-is-to-provide-screw-flights-auger-flight-of-any-size-you-require">Our mission is to provide Screw Flights Auger Flight of any size you require.</h3><p>This innovative design is achieved by hinging the auger casing whilst in situ. The design of the screw is based on the theory of the inclined plane. The Four auger mixer design which is a unique Valmetal signature provides a consistent more thorough mix with fewer fines and eliminates dead spots common to many other auger mixers. The Reel design also requires less horsepower compared to the 4-auger and vertical mixer designs. These mixers have a low-center. Most skid -steer loaders can easily load compost ingredients.</p>
