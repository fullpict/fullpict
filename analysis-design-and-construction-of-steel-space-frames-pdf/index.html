A novel computational workflow is proposed that reduces the construction complexity of freeform space-frame structures by minimizing variability in their joints and achieves a significant reduction in theConstruction complexity in a robust and computationally efficient way. At the preliminary stage of design choosing the type of space frame has to be closely related to the constructional technology.
