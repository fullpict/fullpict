<p>Elastic ﬁbers allow tissues to stretch and recoil. A Dense regular connective tissue consists of collagen fibers packed into parallel bundles. Basement epithelial connective muscle which type of tissue is designed to stretch.</p>
<h3 id="for-example-the-aorta-must-accommodate-large-changes-in-blood-pressure-during-systole-and-diastole">For example the aorta must accommodate large changes in blood pressure during systole and diastole.</h3><p>Reticular fibers are thinner than collagen fibers. Elastic fibers allow tissues to stretch and recoil and are found in structures that are subject to rapid changes in pressure. This type of tissue is composed of scattered cells that form a matrix. Relax the muscle group and allow a passive stretch. Slow-twitch muscle fibers are dense with capillaries and rich in mitochondria and myoglobin a protein that stores oxygen until needed for muscle activity. It is a form of active or passive stretching in which you hold a position for about 30-60 seconds allowing the muscles and their connective tissues fascia to lengthen.</p>
