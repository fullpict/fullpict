<p>II- Absorption chillers. An absorption refrigerator is a refrigerator that uses a heat source eg solar energy a fossil-fueled flame waste heat from factories or district heating systems to provide the energy needed to drive the cooling process. The absorption process is exothermic ie it generates heat and heat must be rejected from the absorber to the condenser water and cooling tower loop.</p>
<h3 id="the-exhaust-strong-solution">The exhaust Strong solution.</h3><p>Extensive analysis of the thermodynamics heat transfer and chemical properties of a three fluid gas absorption system was conducted to design and construct the structural model shown in the report. The absorption chiller modeling is then exploited in a computer tool that gives valuable information on the planning of solar cooling systems. Absorption chiller may be classified to. Generator condenser absorber pump HEX and evaporator. Heat is needed to reset the. The working fluids do not come in contact with the building air.</p>
