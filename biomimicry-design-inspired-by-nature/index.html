<p><strong>Biomimicry Design Inspired By Nature</strong>, Biomimetics also known as biomimicry is a field of study in which scientists examine nature and borrow elements of design to create new technologies or products. Biomimicry or bio-inspired design means taking inspiration from nature and turning it into something that we can use in a technical application. Scientific research in the field of biology alone has already shed light on natures successes and failures throughout billions of years of evolution life flourishing today has successfully evolved while fossils provide evidence of natures inability to overcome diverse challenges.</p>
