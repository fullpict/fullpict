<p>The analysis is conducted to verify the best material for the gears in the gear box at higher speeds by analyzing stress displacement and also by considering weight reduction. Therefore it is called sliding mesh gearbox. 10 INTRODUCTION A differential is a device usually but not necessarily employing gears capable of transmitting torque and rotation through three shafts almost always used in one of two ways. The geometry of the gears to allow for the needed power transmission. Design calculations are done on the differential of Ashokleyland 2516M by varying materials.
