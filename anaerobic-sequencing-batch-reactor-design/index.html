<p>The outcome of the review shows that an appropriate selection pressure is essential to develop proper granules mainly short sludge settling times and relatively high shear stress. Brewery wastewater was treated in a pilot-scale anaerobic sequencing batch reactor ASBR in which a floating cover was employed. Operational parameters 54 C. Two approaches were presented in order to make this anaerobic discontinuous process. The ASBR is a patented process US.
