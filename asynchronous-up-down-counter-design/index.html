<p><strong>Asynchronous Up Down Counter Design</strong>, Here T Flip Flop is used. As we know that in the up-counter each flip-flop is triggered by the normal output of the preceding flip-flop from output Q of first flip-flop to clock of next flip-flop. In certain applications a counter must be able to count both up and down.</p>

HelloHere i explained how to design asynchronous updown counterThanks for watchingwatch my other videos alsoMy videosImportant days in June for the competi.</p>
<h3 id="the-circuit-below-is-a-3-bit-up-down-counter">The circuit below is a 3-bit up-down counter.</h3><p>Asynchronous counters can be easily built using Type D flip-flops. The block diagram of 3-bit Asynchronous binary down counter is similar to the block diagram of 3-bit Asynchronous binary up counter. Both up and down counters are designed using the asynchronous based on clock signal we dont use them widely because of their unreliability at high clock speeds. ASYNCHRONOUS UP DOWN COUNTER. Asynchronous or ripple counters. I have designed the circuitIt counts up during ive cycle.</p>
