<p>It is considered internal combustion those using their own combustion gases and the working fluid ie they are those gases which perform the processes of compression increase in temperature burning expansion and exhaust. Alternative fuels are not equivalent but to a wide. Future H2 internal combustion engines concepts are mainly integrated into electrified powertrains eg.</p>
<h3 id="so-ethanol-has-been-used-widely-as-alternative-fuel-in-internal-combustion-engines">So ethanol has been used widely as alternative fuel in internal combustion engines.</h3><p>In addition to advantages in efficiency and driving range this results in attractive functional synergies and additional degrees of freedom for design and operating strategy which has to be taken into account. According to Rahde 37 thermal engines are classified as internal and external combustion engines. Piston machines are dominant among internal combustion engines. The high octane number of ethanol allows the use of ethanol as fuel in an SI engine with a higher compression ratio 40. The aluminum engine is less costly if manufactured in large quantities. Alternative in this context describes a fuel that can be used in place of a conventional fuel such as gasoline or diesel.</p>
