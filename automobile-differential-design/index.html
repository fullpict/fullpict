On the inner ends of each axle a smaller bevel gear called differential side gear is mounted. The differential is found on all modern cars and trucks and also in many all-wheel-drive full-time four-wheel-drive vehicles. If the inside tire rotates 15 RPM less in a turn than going straight then the outside tire will rotate 15 RPM more than going straight.

<p>The differential is designed to drive a pair of wheels with equal torque while allowing them to rotate at different speeds. In rear-wheel drive cars the differential converts rotational motion of the transmission shaft which lies parallel to the cars motion to rotational motion of the half-shafts on the ends of which are the wheels which lie perpendicular to the cars motion. My Project DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENTIAL GEARBOX mainly focuses on the mechanical design and analysis of gearbox as transmit the power. I had developed this work as my semester project with a view to get familiar with the technologies as well as application of theories into practical work done by industries.
