<p>Plan and Section Drawing by Thomas C. NA2708 W36 1996 Quinn Library. As an architectural tool collage has been used both to imagine surreal spaces and as a conceptual element of planning. Techniques like two point perspective will add dimensionality to your sketchups. Lines that are close together will look darker while lines further apart will indicate highlights.
