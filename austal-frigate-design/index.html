<p>John McCain includes a proposal to build an all-new frigate design in the 4000 to 5000-ton range significantly bigger than LCS. In June this year Austal and ASC Shipbuilding entered into a teaming agreement for the Future Frigates project which would see the companies pool their resources skills and experience and act as one in support of the program. For this phase of the programme Austal is proposing its Independence class Littoral Combat Ship design as the baseline. The detail design and construction contract with Fincantieri covers one ship in the current Fiscal Year. Austal insists on the fact that the seaframe from the maindeck down is virtually identical to the existing LCS design and retains its qualities in terms of performance and affordability.

<p>The design of the first frigate began in October 2018 and commissioning is set for March 2022. Austal builds the the Independence class littoral combat. Our increasing design capability the largest in Australia - will offer more opportunities in Australia for local workforce and for our Australian suppliers Mr Singleton said.

<p>Austal insists on the fact that the seaframe from the maindeck down is virtually identical to the existing LCS design and retains its qualities in terms of performance and affordability. Austal broke ground in March on a new facility that could make it a contender as a second shipyard for the Navys new Constellation-class frigate. Its hoped experience with this design will produce something extra special in its successor. Our increasing design capability the largest in Australia - will offer more opportunities in Australia for local workforce and for our Australian suppliers Mr Singleton said. The Independence class is already in service with the Navy and is the only trimaran design to be so.
