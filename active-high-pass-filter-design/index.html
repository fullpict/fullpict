<p>January 1 2018 By Diksha. As the name suggests a high-pass filter circuit is designed to attenuate all frequencies below a particular selected frequency and pass or allow all frequencies above this threshold. Active high pass filters require either transistors or op amps to provide amplification to the circuit.</p>
<h3 id="be-shown-how-to-design-low-pass-high-pass-and-band-pass-filters-using-this-filter-topology">Be shown how to design low pass high pass and band pass filters using this filter topology.</h3><p>High pass filter basics. The main function of filters is to suppress or filter out components from mixed and unwanted frequency signals to ensure clear communication. Active High Pass Filter as its name implies attenuates low frequencies and passes high frequency signals. For better performance but mainly for amplification. The response of the filter is displayed on graphs. Design a Low Pass filter circuit that has a gain of 10 at low frequencies and a corner frequency of 159Hz.</p>

<p>Now let us see the active high pass filter using inverting op-amp. In an active high pass filter the limitation we have is the op-amp bandwidth. Design a Low Pass filter circuit that has a gain of 10 at low frequencies and a corner frequency of 159Hz. Enter the desired filter parameters and find the resulting circuit diagrams and component values below. The principle is just opposite to a low-pass filter circuit.
