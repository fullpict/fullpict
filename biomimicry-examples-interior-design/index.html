<p><strong>Biomimicry Examples Interior Design</strong>, The study of nature inspiring designs to solve human problems for example hook and loop Velcro designed after bur hooks Yurtkuran Kirli Taneli 2013. This article explores the ways in which biomimicry techniques based on the Design Spiral and Janine Benyus Biomimicry Design Lens Principles of Life can be combined with the design process of an interior design thereby to create a framework with the help of which a designer works and creates a sustainable interior design. In this stunning example of biomimicry the Delfino sonic boat merges inspirations from both dolphins Japanese trains to create a bullet-fast yet super-efficient watercraft.</p>

<p>Benyus 1997 divides solution-driven and problem- driven approaches into three levels of mimicry namely Form Organism Process Behaviour and Eco-system. This bionic dome built by University of Stuttgarts Institute for Computational Design ICD and the Institute of Building Structures and Structural Design ITKE is modeled on the plate skeleton of a sea urchin. Today we discussed biophilia in interior design and touched lightly on the concept of biomimicry.</p>

They provide a framework for designers to determine which aspect of bio to mimic Zari 2007. The lack of a clearly defined approach to biomimicry that interior designers can initially employ particularly if the goal is to increase the sustainability of the built environmentInterior design uses biology as a library of shapes alone as biomimetics without some biology in it. Using carpet tiles in a random non-directional pattern mimics a forest floor and instead of having to replace the entire floor the individual tiles can be replaced resulting in lower maintenance costs and less waste.
