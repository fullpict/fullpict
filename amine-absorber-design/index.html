<p>13 January 2006 pp. The design approach of a packed-bed absorber usually involves the determination of geometrical parameters such as tower diameter D. In gas treating applications for the removal of acid gases with amines using the right simulation tool can make a critical. Amine absorbers use counter-current flow through a trayed or packed tower to provide intimate mixing between the amine solution and the sour gas. Typically small diameter towers use stainless steel packing while larger towers use stainless steel trays.

<p>Two things should be noted. HiIm trying to come up with a design this is more for my self-benefit since my workload is kind of slow lately for an absorber using MDEA as the amine solvent using hysys for the simulation. Therefore it is necessary to properly allow reasonable first. Two things should be noted. Each of these streams is fed to an amine absorber and the lean amine temperature is varied from 10 to 50C.
