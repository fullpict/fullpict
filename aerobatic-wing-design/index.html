<p>Made to achieve an optimal design for an aerobatic aircraft wing structure giv en the weight strength and aeroelastic requirements. Some aerobatic ships are one piece wings. AbstractTo design a highly aerobatic fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle and analyze the performance of it. It was designed to manoeuvre at 10g or -10g load limits to accomplish aerobatic capability. The EXTRA 330 SC is a single seat low-wing aerobatic monoplane with conventional taildragger landinggear offering incredible aerobatic performance for the unlimited competitor or free-style pilot.

<p>A key element of the Hummingbird concept is to simultaneously reduce wing-loading and size over conventional aerobatic aircraft. Right now my sighting device is tape on my canopy marking 90 and 45 degrees but Id really like to get one for my wing tip. Powered by a modified Lycoming IO-540EXP engine the aircraft has exceptional aerobatic performance and is ideal for use in competition aerobatics and airshow displays. As the unmanned aerial vehicles serving the combat application must have desired feature of highly aerobatic in order to complete its. A design intended to be aerobatic should always have symmetrical flight surfaces wing horizontal stabilizer and vertical stabilizer.

<p>AbstractTo design a highly aerobatic fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle and analyze the performance of it. High aspect ratio wings such as sailplanes with high taper ratios tend to be more prone to tip stalls than low aspect ratio wings such as deltas. Some CAP aerobatic planes tend to tip stall easily due to the taper ratio and sharp leading edge. Thanks for the help. From the above spec and design objectives I have a few questions.
